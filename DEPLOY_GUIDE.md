# Debugging and Error Handling Documentation

## Debugging Process

The debugging process focused on identifying and resolving local execution errors and deployment reliability issues in the YouTube Sentiment Analyzer application. The primary areas of investigation were:

- **Backend (API failures, database connectivity):** Although database connectivity issues were mentioned in the task description, this application does not currently use a database. The backend debugging focused on API failures, specifically related to the YouTube API and configuration loading.
- **Frontend (UI rendering, JavaScript errors):** Frontend debugging focused on ensuring graceful error handling for API call failures and providing user-friendly error messages in the UI.
- **Text File Processing:** Debugging and error handling were implemented for text file processing, specifically for the application configuration file (`config.json`).

## Error Resolutions and Implemented Error Handling Mechanisms

### Backend Error Handling

- **Configuration Loading:**
    - **Issue:** The application could fail to load the `config.json` file, leading to API client initialization failures.
    - **Resolution:** Improved error handling in `backend/app.py` to explicitly check for the existence of `config.json` and handle `JSONDecodeError` during parsing. Custom `ConfigError` exception was introduced to represent configuration-related errors.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Modified `backend/app.py` to raise `ConfigError` when `config.json` is not found or cannot be parsed.
        - Added error handler for `ConfigError` in `backend/app.py` to return a 500 error response with an informative error message.

- **YouTube API Client Initialization and Requests:**
    - **Issue:** YouTube API client initialization could fail due to invalid API keys or other issues. API requests could fail due to quota exceeded errors, video not found errors, or other HTTP errors.
    - **Resolution:** Enhanced error handling in `backend/youtube_api.py` to handle specific `HttpError` codes (403, 404, 401, 500, 503) and other exceptions. Custom exception classes (`YouTubeAPIError`, `VideoNotFoundError`, `QuotaExceededError`, etc.) were introduced to represent YouTube API-related errors. API key rotation and rate limiting were already implemented.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Modified `backend/youtube_api.py` to raise custom exceptions (`VideoNotFoundError`, `QuotaExceededError`, etc.) for specific YouTube API errors.
        - Modified `backend/app.py` to include error handler for `YouTubeAPIError` to return appropriate error responses to the frontend, including status codes when available.

### Frontend Error Handling

- **API Call Errors:**
    - **Issue:** Frontend API calls could fail due to network errors, backend server errors, or invalid requests. Errors were not being handled gracefully, potentially leading to blank screens or uninformative error messages.
    - **Resolution:** Implemented basic error handling in `frontend/src/services/api.js` by wrapping all API calls in `try-catch` blocks to log errors to the console and re-throw errors for component-level handling. Integrated `Toast` component to display user-friendly error notifications in the UI.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Modified `frontend/src/services/api.js` to add `try-catch` blocks to all API functions.
        - Imported and integrated `Toast` component in `frontend/src/pages/Analysis.js` and `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` to display error messages using toast notifications.

## Further Steps

- **Deployment Reliability Issues:** Investigate and address deployment reliability issues, including checking Docker configurations, server configurations, and network configurations.
- **Text File Processing Error Handling (Beyond Config):** Identify other text files processed by the application and implement robust error handling for them if necessary.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the implemented error handling solutions across local and deployment environments to ensure they are working as expected.
- **Specific Error Handling in Frontend:** Enhance frontend error handling to handle specific error responses from the backend (e.g., display different messages for 404 vs. 500 errors).
